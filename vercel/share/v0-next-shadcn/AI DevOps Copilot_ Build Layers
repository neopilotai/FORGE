      "text": "Refination Nice problem to tackle 😄 — and that screenshot helps a lot. What you’re describing is **not just a VS Code extension**, it’s an **AI DevOps copilot** that understands **PRs + GitHub Actions logs + codebase state** and can **suggest + fix** issues.\n\nI’ll break this into **practical, buildable layers**, not hand-wavy AI talk.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What You’re Building (Clear Scope)\n\nA VS Code extension that can:\n\n1. **Analyze PRs**\n\n   * Diffs\n   * Failing checks\n   * GitHub Actions logs (like your deploy/publish failures)\n\n2. **Explain failures**\n\n   * Why `deploy #4` failed but `stats #4` passed\n   * Root cause from logs, not just surface errors\n\n3. **Suggest fixes**\n\n   * YAML workflow fixes\n   * Code changes\n   * Dependency/version fixes\n\n4. **Optionally auto-fix**\n\n   * Generate patches\n   * Open PR comments or apply changes locally\n\nThis is basically **GitHub Copilot + Sentry + CI Doctor**, but open and programmable.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 High-Level Architecture\n\n```\nVS Code Extension (UI)\n        |\n        v\nLocal Agent (Node/Python)\n        |\n        v\nAI Reasoning Engine\n        |\n        +--\u003e GitHub API (PRs, Actions, Logs)\n        +--\u003e Repo Workspace (code, diffs)\n        +--\u003e CI Knowledge Base\n```\n\n---\n\n## 1️⃣ VS Code Extension (Frontend)\n\n### Responsibilities\n\n* UI only (don’t do heavy AI here)\n* Collect context\n* Display results\n* Apply patches\n\n### Core Features\n\n* **PR Sidebar**\n* **Failed Action Analyzer**\n* **“Fix This” button**\n\n### Tech\n\n* `TypeScript`\n* VS Code Extension API\n* Webview (React/Svelte optional)\n\n### Key APIs you’ll use\n\n```ts\nvscode.window.createWebviewPanel()\nvscode.workspace.applyEdit()\nvscode.commands.registerCommand()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2️⃣ GitHub Context Ingestor (Critical)\n\nThis is the **brain feeder**.\n\n### Pull Request Data\n\n* Files changed\n* Diffs\n* Comments\n* Check runs\n\n### Actions Log Fetching\n\n```text\nGET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/logs\n```\n\nYou MUST:\n\n* Parse logs\n* Chunk intelligently (logs are huge)\n* Classify failures:\n\n  * build\n  * deploy\n  * permission\n  * missing secrets\n  * version mismatch\n\n👉 This is where most AI tools fail. You can win here.\n\n---\n\n## 3️⃣ CI Log → Structured Events\n\nConvert raw logs into **events**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"job\": \"deploy\",\n  \"step\": \"Upload artifact\",\n  \"error_type\": \"permission_denied\",\n  \"signal\": \"403\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"env\": \"GITHUB_TOKEN\",\n    \"scope\": \"packages:write\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis makes AI **10× smarter**.\n\n---\n\n## 4️⃣ AI Reasoning Layer (Core Intelligence)\n\n### Model Role Separation (IMPORTANT)\n\n| Role            | What it does            |\n| --------------- | ----------------------- |\n| Log Analyst     | Understands CI failures |\n| Code Reviewer   | Reviews PR diff         |\n| Fix Generator   | Produces patches        |\n| Workflow Expert | Fixes YAML              |\n\nUse **multi-agent prompting**, not one big prompt.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nagents:\n  - ci_log_analyst\n  - workflow_fixer\n  - code_reviewer\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5️⃣ Fix Generation Strategy (Safe by Default)\n\n### Levels of Action\n\n1. **Explain only**\n2. **Suggest diff**\n3. **Apply patch**\n4. **Open PR / Comment**\n\nDefault to **#2**.\n\nPatch format:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/.github/workflows/deploy.yml b/.github/workflows/deploy.yml\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6️⃣ VS Code UX (Minimal but Powerful)\n\n### Panels\n\n* 🔴 **Failures**\n* 🧠 **Root Cause**\n* 🛠 **Suggested Fix**\n\n### Commands\n\n```\nAI: Analyze Current PR\nAI: Explain Failed Action\nAI: Generate Fix Patch\nAI: Apply Fix\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7️⃣ Security \u0026 Trust (Very Important)\n\nYou MUST:\n\n* Show **exact prompt**\n* Show **exact diff**\n* Never auto-push\n* Never auto-run code\n\nThis matters for adoption.\n\n---\n\n## 8️⃣ Example: Your Screenshot Case\n\nFrom your image:\n\n* `stats` ✅ passes\n* `deploy` ❌ fails\n* `publish` ❌ fails\n\nAI should infer:\n\n* Build is fine\n* Failure is **post-build**\n* Likely causes:\n\n  * Missing `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions\n  * Package registry auth\n  * Environment mismatch\n\nSuggested fix example:\n\n```yaml\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n  packages: write\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9️⃣ Suggested Repo Structure\n\n```\nai-vscode-reviewer/\n├─ extension/        # VS Code UI\n├─ agent/\n│  ├─ github.ts\n│  ├─ logs.ts\n│  ├─ diff.ts\n│  ├─ analyzer/\n│  ├─ fixers/\n│  └─ prompts/\n├─ models/\n├─ schemas/\n└─ README.md\n```\n\n---\n\n## 10️⃣ Naming Ideas (Strong \u0026 Memorable)\n\nSince you like Warp / Vertex vibes:\n\n* **PRISM** – sees through failures\n* **FORGE** – fixes \u0026 builds\n* **PATCHAI**\n* **CI-SHIELD**\n* **NEO-REVIEW**\n* **RUNBOOK**\n\nMy top pick for you: **FORGE** 🔥\n\n",

Handle the stream.\n*   [ ] **Heuristic Parsing (The \"Sieve\"):**\n    *   Scan for lines starting with `Error:`, `Fatal:`, `FAIL`.\n    *   Scan for exit codes (e.g., `Process completed with exit code 1`).\n*   [ ] **Context Extraction:** When an error line is found, grab 50 lines *before* and 10 lines *after*.\n*   [ ] **Sanitization:** Regex replace sensitive patterns (`sk-proj-...`, `ghp_...`).\n\n\u003e **✅ Checkpoint:** When you click a failed job in the Sidebar, a clean, short ( \u003c100 lines) error snippet prints to the VS Code \"Output\" panel.\n\n---\n\n### 🗓 Phase 3: The Intelligence Layer (Days 6-8)\n**Goal:** Feed the sanitized data to the AI and get a structured diagnosis.\n\n*   [ ] **Context Gathering:** Write a function to fetch the relevant local file.\n    *   *Example:* If `deploy.yml` failed, read `deploy.yml` from the workspace.\n*   [ ] **System Prompting:** Create the prompt in `src/services/ai.ts`.\n    *   *Role:* \"You are a CI Expert...\"\n    *   *Task:* \"Analyze this log snippet + this YAML file.\"\n*   [ ] **LLM Integration:** Connect to OpenAI (GPT-4o) or Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).\n    *   *Tip:* Use `GPT-4o-mini` for dev/testing (cheaper/faster).\n*   [ ] **Structured Output:** Force the AI to return JSON:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"NPM token missing\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The build failed because...\",\n      \"fix_file\": \".github/workflows/deploy.yml\",\n      \"fix_content\": \"...\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n\u003e **✅ Checkpoint:** You run the command, and the AI returns a JSON object accurately explaining *why* the build failed.\n\n---\n\n### 🗓 Phase 4: The Interactive UI (Days 9-12)\n**Goal:** Move from \"Output Panel\" to a rich Webview where users can accept fixes.\n\n*   [ ] **Webview Panel:** Create a React-based Webview.\n    *   Left side: Chat/Explanation.\n    *   Right side: Code preview.\n*   [ ] **Display Diagnosis:** Render the \"Summary\" and \"Explanation\" beautifully (Markdown support).\n*   [ ] **Diff View:** Use `vscode.commands.executeCommand(\u0027vscode.diff\u0027, ...)` to show the user the proposed change vs. current file.\n*   [ ] **Apply Fix:** Implement the \"Fix This\" button using `vscode.WorkspaceEdit`.\n    *   *Crucial:* Do not auto-save. Apply the edit to the open editor so the user must press Ctrl+S.\n\n\u003e **✅ Checkpoint:** You click a failure -\u003e A panel opens explaining the error -\u003e You click \"Show Fix\" -\u003e A Diff opens -\u003e You click \"Apply\" -\u003e The text changes in your editor.\n\n---\n\n### 🗓 Phase 5: Polish \u0026 Ship (Days 13-14)\n**Goal:** Security, performance, and publishing.\n\n*   [ ] **Telemetry:** Add rudimentary logging (no code, just usage stats) to know if people are using it.\n*   [ ] **Rate Limiting:** Ensure you don\u0027t spam the GitHub API or the OpenAI API.\n*   [ ] **Prompt Refinement:** Test against 5 different types of failures (Syntax error, Auth error, Test failure, Timeout, Deprecated Node version).\n*   [ ] **Packaging:** Run `vsce package`.\n*   [ ] **Publish:** Upload to VS Code Marketplace.\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Technical \"Gotchas\" to Watch Out For\n\n1.  **The \"Missing Log\" Issue:** sometimes GitHub takes 10-20 seconds to make logs available via API after a run finishes. You need a retry mechanism.\n2.  **Token Limits:** If a user has a 5,000 line YAML file (monorepo), you might blow the context window. Truncate files if they exceed a certain size.\n3.  **Secrets:** Even with sanitization, be paranoid. Add a disclaimer in the UI: *\"Logs are sent to OpenAI for analysis. Ensure no hardcoded secrets are in your logs.\"*\n\n### 🏁 Start Here (Day 1 Command)\n\n```bash\n# Install the generator\nnpm install -g yo generator-code\n\n# Create the project\nyo code\n# ?
